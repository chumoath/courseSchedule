# Computer Architecture
## resource
  - If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle.

# Algorithms and Data Structures
  - If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems.

# Mathematics for Computer Science
- CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage.

# Operating Systems
  - Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact.

# Database
	- Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work.

# Languages and Compilers
  - If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily.
